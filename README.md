# Movie-Recommendation-System
Have you ever been on an online streaming platform like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Voot? I watched a movie and after some time, that platform started recommending me different movies and TV shows. I wondered, how the movie streaming platform could suggest me content that appealed to me. Then I came across something known as Recommendation System. This system is capable of learning my watching patterns and providing me with relevant suggestions. Having witnessed the fourth industrial revolution where [Artificial Intelligence](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence) and other technologies are dominating the market, I am sure that you must have come across a recommendation system in your everyday life. I am also sure that by this time curiosity must be getting the best of you. Therefore, in this Machine Learning Project, I will teach you to build your own recommendation system. So. let’s start!<br><br>

# What is a Recommendation System?
A <i>recommendation system</i> provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. The information about the user is taken as an input. The information is taken from the input that is in the form of browsing data. This information reflects the prior usage of the product as well as the assigned ratings. A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings. A recommendation system takes the information about the user as an input. The recommendation system is an implementation of <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/">the machine learning algorithms</a>.<br><br>

A recommendation system also finds a similarity between the different products. For example, Netflix Recommendation System provides you with the recommendations of the movies that are similar to the ones that have been watched in the past. Furthermore, there is a collaborative content filtering that provides you with the recommendations in respect with the other users who might have a similar viewing history or preferences. There are two types of recommendation systems – **Content-Based Recommendation System and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation**. In this project, we will work on a collaborative filtering recommendation system and more specifically, **ITEM based collaborative recommendation system.**<br><br>
